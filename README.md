# Credit Risk Analysis Report

# 1. Overview :- 
The purpose of this analysis was to find out if a loan applicant falls into the category of Healthy or High_Risk loan applicant.
For this we split the data into training & testing sets. Created a Logistic Regression Model and evaluated it based on loan risk. We also used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build the model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.


# 2. Results :-
- The accuracy of the model with original data was 95%.
- The recall for '0' (Healthy loan) applicants is 99%, while the recall for '1' (High-Risk loan) applicants is only 91%.
- But The accuracy of the model, fit with oversampled data has increased to 99% balanced accuracy score.
- Also the recall for '1' (High-Risk loan) applicants has increased from 91% to 99%.


# 3. Analysis :-
Our machine learningh model has now a accuracy score of 99%.
So now after using our model the recall for both '0' (healthy loan) and '1' (High-Risk loan) applicants is 99%, which makes our model more robust & accurate than the previous one.
With this model the company can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers and categorise them into healthy or risky loan applicants with 99% accuracy.
